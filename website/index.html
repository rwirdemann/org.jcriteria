<h1>JCriteria</h1>
<h4>A simple Product Owner- / Programmer-oriented ATDD framework in Java.</h4>

</p>
<h2>Basic Idea</h2>
<p>
Current ATDD tools like JBehave or Cucumber force programmers to glue customer written tests to the system under development. Since customers are often overcharged writing given / when / then-style acceptance tests many teams end up writing both: JBehave scenarios and Java glue code.  
</p>
The basic idea behind JCriteria is to provide a simple tool that enforces communication between customers and development teams without forcing customers to program or programmers to write and maintain scenario files.
JCriteria provides the simplest possible link between team and customer by ensuring two things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The customer specifies the business rules of a user story as a set of simple and concise accpetance criteria.
</li>
<li>
The programmer writes a test for each critera in his the programming language and makes sure the business rule is met.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example</h3>
<h4>User Story: transfer_money.story</h4>
<pre>
Title: As a customer I want to transfer money from my account to a destination account.
Criteria: Balance will be reduced by the amount of transferred money
Criteria: Transfer must be legitimated by a valid TAN
Criteria: Customer must be logged in
</pre>
<h4>Java-Class: TransferMoney.java</h4>
<pre>
@RunWith(JCriteriaRunner.class)
public class TransferMoney {
    @Criteria("Balance will be reduced by the amount of transferred money")
    public void shouldReduceBalance() {
	    ...
    }	
}
</pre>
